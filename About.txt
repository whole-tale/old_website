About the Whole Tale

Paragraph here about which button to push

As a <User>, whole tale is a simplified environment to help organize
working with data by managing the data and exploration environments in
one dashboard. 

As a <Developer>, whole tale provides an infrastructure where 
containerized applications, workflows, and interactive environments
can be deployed and easily linked to any data that is registered in the 
system.

(maybe do this as two columns and no click to goto buttons?)

Using Whole Tale

(Do a walkthrough of logging in, finding a tale, and running it)

(Do a second walkthrough once logged in of importing data to a workspace
and then sending that into a new applications to make a new tale)

Developing in Whole Tale

Applications in Whole Tale run within Docker containers. If your application
can be implemented in a Docker Container, it can be run within Whole Tale. 

(Need any details about the stock dockerfile needed to access the 
data directories)

The framework for Whole Talke is constructed as such...

(Diagram showing the tech stack we use)

All data are exposed to the containers through a FUSE based file system. 
With this system, files are not downloaded into the system until first accessed.
Applications will wait for this transfer to begin. 

All of the software components are hosted in GitHub repo at...

The system is fully API driven. These APIs are exposed as...Thus
external systems can publish data or compute on data using WholeTale 
in a fully API (non interactive) fashion.
