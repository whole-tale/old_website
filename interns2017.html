        <h1>Summer 2017 Internships</h1>
          <p>Scholarly publications are often disconnected from the underlying data and code that was used to produce the findings. There is no shortage of tools and cyberinfrastructure (CI) addressing specific aspects of this challenge, yet scientists find it difficult to utilize these different pieces and building blocks in a seamless way that spans the “whole story”, i.e., from conducting the computational science to the publication of a “living” or executable  paper. These new types of publications include not only the science narrative, but also (references to) all the relevant data, code, and provenance information needed to reproduce and experience the computational and research processes described by the paper.</p>
          <p><a href="index.html">Whole Tale: <i>Merging Science and Cyberinfrastructure Pathways</i></a> is an NSF-funded project that will enable researchers to examine, transform and then seamlessly re-publish research data that was used in an article. As a result, these “living articles” enable new discovery by allowing researchers to construct representations and syntheses of data. Whole Tale is a collaboration led by the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in collaboration with partners at the University of Chicago, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of Notre Dame. We are pleased to announce the availability of summer research internships for undergraduates, graduate students and recent postgraduates!</p>

        <h3>Program Information</h3>
          <p>Interns undertake a 9-week program of work centered around one of the projects listed below. Each intern will be paired with one or more mentors. Interns need not necessarily be at the same location or institution as any of their mentors. Interns and mentors are expected to have a virtual or face-to-face meeting at the beginning of the summer, maintain frequent communication throughout the program and interns are required to keep an online notebook.</p>

        <h3>Eligibility</h3>
          <p>The program is open to undergraduate students, graduate students, and postgraduates who have received their degree within the past five years. There are no restrictions on academic backgrounds or field of study (but see details below). Interns must be at least 18 years of age by the program start date, <b>must be currently enrolled or employed at a U.S. university or other research institution and must currently reside in, and be eligible to work in, the United States</b>. Interns are expected to be available approximately 40 hours/week during the internship period with significant availability during the normal business hours. </p>

        <h3>Financial Support</h3>
          <p>Interns will receive a stipend of $5,000 for participation, paid in two installments (one at the midterm and one at the conclusion of the program). In addition, if travel to a project meeting is necessary, required travel expenses will be borne by the Whole Tale project. Participation in the program after the mid-term is contingent on satisfactory performance. The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign will administer funds. Interns will need to supply their own computing equipment and internet connection. For students who are not US citizens or permanent residents, complete visa information will be required, and it may be necessary for the funds to be paid through the student’s university or research institution. In such cases, the student will need to provide the necessary contact information for their organization.</p>

        <h3>To Apply</h3>
          <p>Required application materials include: 1) a resume that includes educational history, current position, any publications or honors, and full contact information (including phone number, e-mail address, and mailing address); 2) a cover letter identifying the project you are interested in, the contributions you expect to make to the project, relevant background, value of the internship program to your career objectives and your approach to meeting the project deliverables; and <b>optionally</b>: 3) a letter of reference.</p>

        <p><b>Desirable Skills / Qualifications:</b></p>  
          <ul>
            <li>Experience with data analysis toolkits (e.g., Python Pandas, SciPy, R)</li>
            <li>Some experience with statistical modelling and/or machine learning</li>
            <li>Basic knowledge of materials science</li>
          </ul>
        <p><b>Expected Outcomes:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Jupyter notebooks that reproduce published results using data contained in MDF</li>
            <li>Published models, notebooks, and derived data</li>
            <li>New models created from mixing several MDF datasets</li>
            <li>Conversion and ingestion of existing materials datasets into MDF</li>
          </ul>
        <p><b>Project Description:</b></p>
        <p>There is a vast amount of materials science data (computational or experimental) available in repositories such as the Materials Data Facility (MDF), Materials Project, AFLOWLib, Citrination, and NOMAD, among others. While much of these data has been analyzed in isolation, little have been used collectively to develop new models and drive new discovery. In this project, the student will develop methods for accessing data contained within the MDF and other repositories directly from within Jupyter notebooks. Such a tool will enable better reproducibility and easier re-use for the increasingly common machine learning models created from materials data.</p>
        <p>After developing a model to access data, the student will then work to recreate several machine learning methods from the literature to explore these datasets, and then branch to applying these tools to new data. For example, the student will implement models that determine whether metallic alloys can be formed as glasses (see figure below). Having implemented these models and reproduced published results, the student will apply the underlying model to a wider range of data contained in the MDF. At this point, there are several possible routes for continuing the project, including benchmarking several machine learning methods using the same datasets or exploring how to best mix different data sources to train a single model. As a result of this work, the student will publish the resulting notebooks, models, and derived data in the MDF such that others can discover, reproduce, and build upon their work.</p>

        <p><b>Project Description:</b></p>
        <p>The task of building infrastructure that supports and promotes reproducible science involves addressing multiple challenges. One major challenge involves understanding the existing practices and requirements of the domain researchers for whom the infrastructure will be built. Developing this understanding is critical for: identifying where infrastructure development is best targeted; specifying what features should be incorporated into this infrastructure; and ensuring that researchers are able to integrate this infrastructure easily into their work practices.</p>
        <p>This project will involve studying a team of researchers from one of the Whole Tale Science Pathways domains (astronomy, archaeology, material science, biology/genomics, social science, disaster resilience): the particular domain will be selected to closely match with your own interests/background.</p>
        <p>You will work with the research team to learn about their work and information practices. These practices include: how they produce, manage, and use data and software; whether and how they make their data and software accessible to others; and their associated record-keeping practices. Your work will involve interviewing team members about their practices, and observing them at work.</p>
        <p>After identifying the team’s existing information practices, you will explore what infrastructure and practices could make this team’s work more reproducible. In addition, you may also identify particular barriers and challenges to introducing new infrastructure and practices into the work practices of the team.</p>
        <p>Based on your findings, you will formulate a series of use cases. These use cases will represent your findings to software engineers who are building infrastructure to promote reproducible research.</p>
