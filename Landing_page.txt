The Whole Tale

Merging Science and Cyberinfrastructure Pathways

Whole Tale is a system which enables data providers, application
developers, and researchers to merge their expertises to simplify the
complex world of modern data research. Anyone can register data in
whole tale, be that a full repository or simply data from your lab or
laptop.  Anyone can use applications in the system to work with data
to produce outcomes in a collaborative environment. Anyone
can publish the tale of how data were converted to knowledge
and associate that tale with the reseach articles to which they lead. As
a result, these "living articles" enable future discovery of past
results and extending them with new data or applications.
